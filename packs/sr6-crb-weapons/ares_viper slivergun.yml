  description: >-
    30(c)The unique Slivergun hangs out in the Heavy Pistol class,  but it s a
    creature all its own. The Slivergun fires metal slivers tha t count as
    flechette ammunition and are bought as such, but they aren t interchangeabl
    e with any other flechette weapon. The weapon remains capable of Burst Fire
    an d has a silencer integrated into the barrel, and the large ammo capacity
    make s it a terror on the streets.
