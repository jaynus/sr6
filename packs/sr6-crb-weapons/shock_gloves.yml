  description: >-
    Insulated gloves with an integrated system that discharges electric current
    with any contact after they ve been activated. The gloves inflict the Zapped
    status (p. 53) and are good for ten charges before they need to be plugged
    in and recharged (at a rate of one charge per ten seconds). The charge is
    activated with a muscle command or via wireless signal, which takes a Minor
    Action. Wireless bonus: You gain a bonus Minor Action on a turn when you
    activate a charge. The shock gloves recharge by induction, regaining one
    charge per half hour of wireless-enabled time.
