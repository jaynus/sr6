  description: >-
    A riot-control staple and viewed as a symbol of corporate-government
    oppression, this handy electrical prod is still useful for everyone in the
    shadows. The stun baton holds ten charges and regains one charge per ten
    seconds when plugged in. Wireless bonus: The stun baton recharges without
    being plugged in, regaining one charge per half hour of wireless-enabled
    time.
