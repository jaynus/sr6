    Pretty and deadly are not mutually exclusive. Fichetti gunsmithing combined
    with Tiffani style makes the Needler the single most popular designer
    handgun in the world. The base model is matte grey, but its special
    color-changing coating can be manipulated via wireless signal with an
    infinite number of patterns and designs. The coating allows your gun to
    match your shoes, your handbag, or the camo pattern of your fatigues. The
    Needler only chambers caseless flechette rounds, which are already factored
    into its damage code. Wireless bonus: You can change the color of the
    Fichetti Tiffani Needler with a Minor Action. Applying a camouflage pattern
    to the Needler increases the concealability threshold by 1 for visual
    Perception tests.
