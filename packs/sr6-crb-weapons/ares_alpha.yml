    Made famous in the hands of Ares Firewatch teams, the Alpha quickly became a
    worldwide success with UCAS and CAS special operators along with a myriad of
    Desert Wars teams. The integrated underbarrel grenade launcher, smartgun
    system, and an innovative design for superior handling make it special.
