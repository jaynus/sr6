  description: >-
    Specifically designed with a cutting edge on one side and a serrated sawing
    edge on the other, the tru e surviva l piece of this knife is in the handle
    and its collection of accessories. In the handle yo u ll find a GPS monitor,
    mini-multitool, and micro-lighter. The blade is coated with a photovoltaic
    skin that blacks out the blade to prevent unwanted reflection; when charged,
    the skin can be activated to provide two hours of light. Combat stats are
    the same as the combat knife. Wireless bonus: The knife displays an ARO of
    local maps and your GPS position, along with providing basic biomonitor data
    when in your hand.
