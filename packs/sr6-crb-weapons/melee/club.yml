  description: >-
    The stats listed can be used for a range of objects, including an axe
    handle, baseball bat, crowbar, tire iron, wrench, or even a two-by-four with
    a couple nails in it. The price listed is for a professionally made,
    old-style police baton, but it would be relatively easy to find one for free
    in a pinch.
