  description: >-
    A big stick that starts out as a small stick. This metal and composite staff
    can telescope down to the size of a stun baton or a sword. It can be
    extended and locked in place by spinning or snapping it out in each
    direction and giving the handle a twist to lock it. Or it can use a wireless
    signal to activate the telescoping effect. Extending or retracting it takes
    a Minor Action. Wireless bonus: You gain a bonus Minor Action on a turn when
    you retract or extend the baton.
