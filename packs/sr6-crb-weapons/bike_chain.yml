  description: >-
    Go-gangs love to pull the old equipment off their scrap bikes and smack
    other people with it. These heavy metal chains are brutal weapons,
    especially when backed by the speed of a motorcycle. You gain a bonus Minor
    Action on a turn when you use the Trip Minor Action with this weapon.
