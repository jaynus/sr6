  description: >-
    Take a long stick, add any of a dozen varieties of blades to the head, and
    you ve got a polearm. Designed to keep distance between attacker and
    defender or strike at a mounted target, the y re not common street weapons.
    They re nearly impossible to conceal, even for a troll, but they re great at
    keeping problems at a safe distance.
