  description: >-
    28(c)Heckler & Koch know how to design an SMG, since the 227 ha s been built
    off the same frame (the venerable MP5) for over a century. A top choice for
    corporate and military security forces, the HK 227 offers a
     retractable stock, integrated smartgun system, and an integral
    barrel-mounte d silencer.
