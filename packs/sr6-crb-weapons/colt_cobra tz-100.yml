    Colt loves variety, and the Cobra TZ series highlights the options they
    offer with this line. The 100 is the base model with an integral folding
    stock, the 110 adds a top-mounted laser sight, the 120 feature the folding
    stock, top-mounted laser sight, and a barrel-mounted gas-vent system, making
    it a hit with security forces all over the world and with trid shows that
    love all the fancy feature.
