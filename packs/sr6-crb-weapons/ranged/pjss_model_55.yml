    Rich people own shotguns too. Small production runs, usually purchased by
    rich European hunters and trap shooters, make this a status symbol made for
    killing. The Model 55 comes with a rigid stock equipped with an integrated
    shock pad. Both barrels can be shot at once as a short burst (see Not Enough
    Rounds, p. 109).
