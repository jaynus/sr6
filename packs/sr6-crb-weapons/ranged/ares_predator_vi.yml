  description: >-
    15(c)The Predator V rode on the laurels of its name. The Predato r VI is
    genuine innovation built into some classic styling. Built on the framing
     of the original Predator, the VI comes with the standard smartgun
    operation s but adds Burst Fire capability and a new variable ammunition
    system that wil l make it king of the streets and warzones once again, even
    if it comes wit h a price tag to match that innovation. The variable
    ammunition system allow s a single specially designed magazine (30\xA5 per
    spare) to be loaded with differen t ammo types. The smartgun is used to
    select ammo types and cycles them to th e chamber in whatever quantity is
    necessary and available. If there are n t enough rounds of a particular
    kind, the ammo counter reads empty and the weapo n stops firing.
