  description: >-
    14(c)Governments need new weapons contracts for bribe purposes,  so having a
    new standard issue after only ten years seems about par for the course. The
    years of technomancer and hacker fear since th e 60s have left the
    electronic firing 2066 in a lot of storage cabinets for fear of hacking. 
    The 2076 takes a jump back to the style of the classic Manhunter (in fact,
    th e model with an integrated smartgun system has that denotation) and comes
    wit h an integral laser sight.
