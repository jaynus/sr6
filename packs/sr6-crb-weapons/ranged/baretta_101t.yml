  description: >-
    21(c)The preferred sidearm of many security forces around th e world, the
    T-series is classified as a light pistol, even though the 201 design offers
    automatic fire capability, making it popular in nations that limit heav y
    and machine pistols. Since the frame is the same, it s easier to disguis e
    as a 101. The 201 also comes with a detachable shoulder stock, though it i s
    often lost before the gun reaches the street market.
