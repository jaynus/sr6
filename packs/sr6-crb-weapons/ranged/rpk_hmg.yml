    50(c) or 100(belt)

    This heavy machine gun is used by militaries across eastern Europe and Asia.
    Usually set up as a vehicle-mounted weapon, it comes standard with a
    detachable tripod, as the RPK is best fired from a prone, sitting, or
    kneeling position when not mounted on a vehicle.
