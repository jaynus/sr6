    Sometimes you need to shoot an enemy; sometimes you need to shoot an enemy
    through the side of an APC. The Barret Model 122 excels at tearing through
    metal and getting to the things it attempts to protect, ripping apart
    machines and vehicles with horrible tearing sounds that are music to the
    ears of the shooter. It has a silencer, smartgun system, and folding bipod.
