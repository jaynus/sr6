  description: >-
    16(c)The Light Fire Series is designed for special operators.  The 70 is a
    street standard, while the 75 is not commonly available throug h regular
    dealers and standard legal channels. But what runner uses those? The
    integration of a barrel-mounted silencer in both designs makes the Light Fir
    e series nearly trid-flick silent. The 75 comes preloaded with smartlink
    hardwar e and software, and both come with a laser sight. The silencer for
    these model s increases the threshold for audio Perception tests by 3 for
    the Light Fire Serie s when equipped and costs 750\xA5.
