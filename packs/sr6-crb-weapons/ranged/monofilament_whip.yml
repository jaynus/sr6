  description: >-
    Striking fear in the hearts of those who have warily watched its serpentine
    glow since the 2050s. In the hands of a trained user, this terrifying weapon
    can cut through armor, flesh, and bone as easy as butter with every
    millimeter of its two meters of monofilament line. In the wrong hands, or
    even with a bad twist of a skilled wrist, that line can send you to the
    street doc looking for a new limb. The whip is stored in the specially
    designed compartment in the handle with a small weight that detaches when
    the weapon is activated. Glitches are handled as usual, but a critical
    glitch always requires the wielder to resist the base damage of the weapon.
    Whips add the attackers Reaction instead of Strength to Attack Rating.
    Wireless bonus: The whip uses your visuals on the target to make small
    adjustments in targeting, and the whip adjusts its trajectory. This
    increases the Attack Rating by 2. Also, the whip s built-in safety system
    retracts automatically instead of hitting you on a critical glitch.
