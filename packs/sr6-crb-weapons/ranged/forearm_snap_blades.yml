  description: >-
    Don t like getting implants but still want three razor sharp blades to pop
    out of your forearm? This is the weapon for you. The blades extend and
    retract through either a forearm muscle command or a wireless signal. Either
    way, it takes a Minor Action. Wireless bonus: The blades grant an extra
    Minor Action on the turn when they are extended or retracted.
