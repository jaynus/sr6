  description: >-
    Whether you re Neal the Firefighter or Neil the Ork Barbarian, you can swing
    an axe for both utility and violence. The combat axe come with a single or
    double blade and a hardened spring-loaded thrusting point for breaking glass
    or providing an unpleasant surprise. In the overmuscled hands of a 2080s
    street warrior, this weapon can be far deadlier than a firearm.
