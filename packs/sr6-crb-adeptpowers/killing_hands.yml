    Your hands become lethal and magical, useful both in shadowrunning and
    cheesy pickup lines. When fighting unarmed, you can choose to deal Stun or
    Physical damage. Killing Hands can be combined with other powers affecting
    unarmed combat. Attacks made with Killing Hands are considered magical,
    meaning they bypass protections against normal weapons and can be made
    against astral beings.
