    Running horizontally is so pedestrian (get it?). Running up a wall is how
    you show you’re special. When using this power, you can use a Sprint action
    (see p. 44) to run up a vertical surface. You cannot use this power for two
    actions in a row; you have to spend at least one turn moving across a
    horizontal surface before using this power again. So if you run up a wall
    and don’t find a good foot or handhold, you’ll be falling right back down.
