    Mana flows into your body and enhances your inherent abilities, carrying you
    to a superior level. When purchasing this ability, it must be applied to a
    specific Physical attribute (Body, Agility, Reaction, or Strength); if this
    power is purchased multiple times, it can be used to either increase the
    rank connected to an already-selected attribute (up to 6) or to apply to a
    new attribute. It cannot be applied to Mental or Special attributes.    
    When this power is activated, roll Magic + Attribute Boost rating. Each hit
    temporarily boosts the rating of the designated attribute by 1, up to the
    augmented maximum of +4. This only affects dice pools, so your Initiative
    rank, Condition Monitor, Defense Rating, and so forth is not changed. The
    effect lasts for (net hits) combat rounds, and when it runs out, the adept
    takes drain equal to the level of this power, resisted as normal.
