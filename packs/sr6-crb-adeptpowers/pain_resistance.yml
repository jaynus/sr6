    Pain hurts, but you gain an elevated ability to ignore it. For each level of
    this power, the negative modifiers from damage move one box farther down the
    Condition Monitor—for example, at level 1, you don’t suffer the –1 penalty
    until 4 boxes are filled on a Condition Monitor, rather than 3. It works for
    both Stun and Physical Condition Monitors.
