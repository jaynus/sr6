    A skill must be selected when this power is chosen. That skill receives an
    ongoing boost equal to the rating of the power. The maximum boosted value of
    the skill is 1.5 times the original (rounded up) or the augmented maximum,
    whichever is lower. You need to have at least one rank in a skill to buy
    this power for it, and the power can be purchased for multiple skills.
