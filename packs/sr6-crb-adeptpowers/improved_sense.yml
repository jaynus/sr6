    When this power is purchased, select a sense (sight, hearing, touch, taste,
    or smell). When making a test involving that sense, you get a bonus Edge,
    but only if you use it (either alone or in combination with other Edge
    points) on that test. Edge points from this power cannot be gained more than
    once when the same sense (noise, sight, flavor, etc.) is involved. This
    power can be selected more than once, each time for a different sense.
