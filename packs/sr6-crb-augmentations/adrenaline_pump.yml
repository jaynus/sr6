  description: >-
    This enhanced gland is implanted in the lower abdomen, connected to both
    supradrenal glands. When dormant, the pump is merely a reservoir for
    adrenaline. When activated, a small muscular sac contracts, sending a surge
    of concentrated adrenaline into the blood stream. Physical and emotional
    stress can force your pump to activate if you fail a Composure test (p. 67);
    otherwise you can trigger it as a Minor Action. While the pump is active,
    you ignore injury modifiers, don’t fall unconscious even if your Stun
    Condition Monitor is filled, you can’t rest, and the adrenaline pump’s
    rating is added to your Strength, Agility, Reaction, and Willpower
    attributes. The pump works for (rating x 1D6) combat rounds, and it can’t be
    switched off early. When time’s up, you crash and take Stun damage equal to
    one half, rounded up, of the number of combat rounds the pump was active
    (use unaugmented Body to resist the damage). After the effect’s end, your
    attribute values return to normal and you stop ignoring injury modifiers or
    unconsciousness from Stun damage. After use, the pump requires one hour to
    regenerate its supply. During that time, it cannot be activated.
