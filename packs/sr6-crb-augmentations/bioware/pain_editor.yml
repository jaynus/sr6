  description: >-
    This cluster of specialized nervous tissue is designed to filter sensory
    stimuli. If the pain editor is active, this allows you to ignore all injury
    modifiers, and you even stay conscious when your Stun Condition Monitor is
    completely full. You feel no pain—you’re blissfully, dangerously, recklessly
    unaware of the extent of damage you’ve taken without either performing a
    self-examination (Observe in Detail action) or being informed by a
    biomonitor (p. 281). While active, the pain editor increases your Willpower
    by 1 and decreases your Intuition by 1; additionally, all tactile Perception
    tests you make have their threshold increased by 1.
