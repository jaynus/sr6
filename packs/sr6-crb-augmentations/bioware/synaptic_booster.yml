  description: >-
    The nerve cells making up the spinal cord are both broadened and replicated
    with this bioware, allowing for more neural bandwidth. The result is a much
    faster reaction time. The booster confers a bonus of +1 Reaction (with
    accompanying bonus to your Initiative Score) and 1 additional Initiative Die
    (with accompanying Minor Action). The synaptic booster cannot be combined
    with any other form of Reaction or Initiative enhancement. Unlike other
    enhancements, this cannot be turned off, leaving the user in a perpetual
    state of being surrounded by slow motion.
