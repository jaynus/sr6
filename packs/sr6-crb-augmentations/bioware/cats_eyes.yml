  description: >-
    These transgenic vat-grown implants are very literally cats’ eyes with a
    modified DNA profile and occipital connecting structures. The structure of
    cat’s eyes amplifies light and enhances night vi-sion, providing low-light
    vision (p. 72). Cat’s eyes are slit and reflective, just like, well, a
    cat’s. This bioware is obviously not compatible with cyberware eye
    replacements, but individual vision enhancements can be purchased.
