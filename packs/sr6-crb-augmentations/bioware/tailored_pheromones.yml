    These pheromones are specially tailored to subtly influence others and can
    be released at will. Tailored pheromones increase your Charisma attribute by
    their Rating for Con and Influence tests, but only when the person you’re
    using them on is within a comfortable conversation range—if they can’t smell
    you, the pheromones don’t work. Tailored pheromones have no effect on
    magical abilities and tests.
