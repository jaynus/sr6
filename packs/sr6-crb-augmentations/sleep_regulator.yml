    The sleep regulator is a modification to the hypothalamus, allowing for
    longer periods of wakefulness, an incredibly useful advantage for anyone
    with any profession, not just shadowrunners. You need less sleep per day,
    and the sleep you get is deep and restful (and harder to wake you up from).
    The sleep regulator lets you get by with three hours of sleep each night,
    and you can stay awake for twice as long as normal without acquiring the
    Fatigued status (p. 52). Resting hours for healing purposes are not
    affected.
