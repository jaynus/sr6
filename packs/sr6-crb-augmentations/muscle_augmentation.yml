    This biological weaving treatment enhances existing muscle tissue, rather
    than replacing it with vat-grown muscles. Specially grown muscle cables are
    woven into existing muscle fibers, enhancing muscle mass and brute strength
    while providing a bulkier look. Muscle augmentation adds its rating to your
    Strength attribute. This bioware is incompatible with augmentations that
    increase Strength, including the muscle replacement cyberware.
