    Damage compensators are essentially cut-offs stored in the nervous pathways
    that report pain from the body back to your brain. You ignore a number of
    damage boxes (your choice of Physical, Stun, or a combination of the two)
    equal to the compensatorâ€™s rating before determining your injury modifiers.
