    You gain a bonus Edge when making Matrix Damage Resistance tests. If you do
    not use that point of Edge immediately on the Damage Resistance test, it
    goes away. When struck by any damage in the Matrix, you can convert up to
    two boxes to Stun Damage, rather than Matrix damage, protecting your persona
    at the cost of yourself.
