  description: >-
    Characters take a –2 penalty on Memory tests (p. 67) to remember if they
    have seen you before, and the threshold on tests to notice if you are
    following or observing them is increased by 1. If the character acquires
    something permanent and distinctive—obvious, unusual cyberware, a unique
    tattoo, that sort of thing—they lose this quality. If they acquire something
    temporarily distinctive, such as an extreme hairdo, the effects are negated
    until those changes are reversed.
