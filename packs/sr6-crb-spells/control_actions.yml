  description: >-
    The spellcaster acts as master puppeteer, taking control of anothe r person
    and making them dance to their tune. Roll Sorcery + Magic vs. Willpowe r +
    Logic; net hits give the maximum duration of the spell in minutes. The targe
    t is aware of what is happening to them but can do little about it. The
    caste r uses the same actions to command the individual as the action they
    are tellin g them to take, so that having them move is a Minor Action, but
    having them attac k is a Major Action. This spell can be made into an area
    spell by using th e Increase Area adjustment. Once the spell is cast, the
    effect stays with individual s who did not resist the spell, even if they
    move out of the initial area.
