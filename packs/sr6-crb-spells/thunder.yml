    A big, loud distraction can be useful, and thats what this spel l offers. By
    casting it, the magician shapes sound wages into a noise of thei r choice it
    might sound like the spells namesake, or the roar of rush-hou r traffic, or
    the distant babble of shouted voices, or some other such din. Th e basic
    area affected by the spell is a two-meter-radius sphere; this can be expande
    d with the Increase Area effect. For each hit on the Sorcery + Magic test,
    th e noise continues for 1 combat round after the spell is dropped by the
    caster.  Net hits serve as a negative dice pool modifier on those trying to
    hear othe r noises in the area.
