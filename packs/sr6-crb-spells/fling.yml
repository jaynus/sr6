    objects into the sky, only without a catapult,  then you re our sort of
    person, and this spell is for you. Roll Sorcery + Magic vs. Object
    Resistance. For each net hit, you can fling half a kilogram of material int
    o the air, and net hits also act as a threshold for a Reaction + Intuition
    tes t for targets to avoid the object. The flung object has the following
    Attack Ratings: Close (Magic), Near: (Magic + 2), Medium (Magic + 1), Far:
    (Magic 2), Extreme:  , and it does Stun damage equal to kilograms of weight,
    rounded up.
