    The touch of the mage strengthens, speeds, or enlightens the target,
    temporarily raising one of their attributes. The caster decides which
    attribut e to target before casting the spell. The caster rolls a Sorcery +
    Magic (5    Essence) test. They can select how many net hits they actually
    apply to th e target to increase the selected attribute, at a rate of 1
    point of increas e per net hit (maximum bonus +4); for each net hit applied
    beyond the first, th e Drain Value of the spell increases by 1. The spell
    cannot affect Edge, Essence,  Magic, or Resonance.
