  description: >-
    Whether youre trying to solidify a wall that your opponent s are trying to
    breach or cut down the noise from the people that are roller skatin g or
    something in the apartment above yours, making an existing wall a little
    stronger can be useful. Roll Sorcery + Magic vs. Object Resistance for the
    wal l you are trying to affect; net hits increase the Structure rating by 1
    per ne t hit. You can affect four square meters of wall with the base
    version of thi s spell; using the Increase Area effect increases this by
    four square meters pe r point of DV added. The Shift Area effect can be used
    for this spell.
