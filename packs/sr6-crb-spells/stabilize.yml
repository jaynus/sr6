    This is the spell to use when someone is in Overflow damage and is
    sustaining an ongoing damaging effect or status. Roll Sorcery + Magic, with
    a threshold of the number of Overflow boxes of damage the target has.
    Meeting the threshold means the target is stabilized , and all Overflow
    damage is removed. The net hits can only affect Overflow damage and cannot
    heal regular damage.
