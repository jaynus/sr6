    The touch of the mage weakens, slows, or stupefies the target, temporarily
    lowering one of their attributes (to a minimum of 1). The caster decides
    which attribute to target before casting the spell. The caster rolls a
    Sorcery + Magic vs. Willpower + targeted attribute. They can select how many
    net hits they actually apply to the target at a rate of 1 point of decrease
    per net hit; for each net hit applied beyond the first, the Drain Value of
    the spell increases by 1. The spell cannot affect Edge, Essence, Magic, or
    Resonance.
