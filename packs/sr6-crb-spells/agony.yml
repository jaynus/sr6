    This spell brings pain but not actual damage. Roll Sorcery + Magi c vs.
    Willpower + Logic; each net hit acts like an additional box of damage in
    both the Physical and Stun Condition Monitors for the purposes of determinin
    g penalties due to injuries. If one or both Condition Monitors are completel
    y filled, the targeted individual stays conscious but is so wracked with pai
    n that they cannot act. Once the spell is dropped, there is no ongoing effec
    t from the pain. The base spell affects only an individual, but the Increas
    e Area effect can be applied to make it an area spell (starting at 2m radius
    fo r +1 DV).
