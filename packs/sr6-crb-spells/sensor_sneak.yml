    Multi-Sense: This spell affects multiple senses simultaneously. Improved
    Invisibility and Physical Mask and the like are great when you want to hide
    from both prying eyes and technology, but what about when there are no
     living beings around, only cameras, sensors, and the like? Sensor Sneak is
    th e spell for that. It gives the target a version of the Invisible
    (Improved) (#)  status, but it has no effect on living and sentient beings,
    only technology-base d sensors.
