    Single-Sense: This spell affects only one sense. Silence descend s on that
    target, making them unable to make a noise even if they tried. Thi s can be
    great for people trying to sneak by a target, or a good way to throw
     disruption among people depending on vocal communication. Hush gives
    target s the Silent (#) status (see p. 53), with the number equaling the net
    hits o n the Sorcery + Magic test. That number acts as a threshold for any
    attempts t o hear the character. Silence acts the same, but it gives the
    Silent (Improved)  (#) status, so that microphones and other technology also
    will not hear th e targeted character.
