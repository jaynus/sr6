  description: >-
    This spell sends mana coursing through the body to find and purge toxins.
    Roll a Sorcery + Magic test. Each hit reduces the toxin power by one. The
    mage may spend consecutive major actions to roll again without recasting. If
    the power hits zero, any ongoing effects of the toxin are eliminated.
