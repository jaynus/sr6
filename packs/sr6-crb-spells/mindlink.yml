    Commlinks and text messaging? So pass\xE9. Just throw your thought s into
    someone elses mind for the ultimate in rapid communication! As lon g as you
    get a hit on the Sorcery + Magic test, you have a link, and you can share
    mental communication in whatever form makes sense to you and subject of thi
    s spell. The caster and the subject must remain within range of each other
    fo r the link to continue functioning; if they move out of sense range and
    then com e back into it, they can pick up the communication again, as long
    as the spel l was continuously sustained.
