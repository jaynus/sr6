    Multi-Sense: This spell affects multiple senses simultaneously. Sometimes
    you dont want to be seen; other times, you want to be seen as someone you
    are not. Mask is for the latter. The spell changes the critical
     characteristics of the person their appearance, their sound, their
    scent,  and so forth. Roll Sorcery + Magic and record the number of hits;
    those hit s are used as a threshold when people try to see through the
    illusion, which require s an Willpower + Intuition test. Mask affects only
    living, sentient beings; Physica l Mask affects cameras, microphones, and
    other technology.
