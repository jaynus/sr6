    Similar to Control Actions but more insidious, this puts the spellcaster
    inside the head of the target, making them think what the spellcaster wants
     them to. Roll Sorcery + Magic vs. Willpower + Logic; net hits give the
    maximum duration of the spell in minutes. Unlike Control Actions, the target
    s awareness of Control Thoughts being used on them is uncertain. The closer
    th e thoughts are to the targets normal thoughts, the less likely they ar e
    to notice the intrusion. At the gamemasters discretion, they can hav e the
    target make a Logic + Intuition test after the spell wears off to recognize
    the spells effect on them with a threshold based on how different fro m
    normal their thoughts were made to be. While the spellcaster plays a
    powerful role in shaping the individuals thoughts, certain instincts are
    very difficult to override. Thoughts lik e I should jump off this building
     o r I should attack my best friend/spouse/partner are generally going to
    b e resisted. With thoughts such as these, the gamemaster can have the
    target rol l another Willpower + Logic test to resist the suggestion, and
    they may gain Edg e before the test if the thought is too far outside their
    normal thought proces s or if it violates their basic instincts.
