    Multi-Sense: This spell affects multiple senses simultaneously. Confusion
    hits the target with a swirl of images and emotions that leave the m
    disoriented and, well, confused. Roll Sorcery + Magic vs. Willpower +
    Logic;  the target gains the Confused (#) status, with the number equaling
    the net hit s on the test. The target experiences a dice pool penalty equal
    to that numbe r on all tests besides Damage Resistance tests. Chaos has the
    same effect, excep t it also affects cameras, microphones, and other forms
    of technology. The bas e spell affects only an individual, but the Increase
    Area effect can be applie d to make it an area spell (starting with a 2m
    radius). When it is an area spell,  the Shift Area effect can be used.
