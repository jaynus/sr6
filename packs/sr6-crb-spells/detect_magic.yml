    No one wants to sort through an entire landfill to find the magi c ring
    sitting amid all the trash, but sometimes thats the job. Which i s why an
    enterprising mage developed this spell, which alerts the caster to any forms
    of active magic within the senses range. This includes foci, reagents, 
    active spells, wards, alchemical preparations, spirits, and active rituals, 
    but does not include Awakened people, critters, astral signatures, alchemica
    l preparations that have been triggered or lost their potency, or the effect
    s of permanent spells once they have become permanent.
