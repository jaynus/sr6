    Sometimes you want to keep magic away from you, and other times you want to
    keep absolutely everything you can away. Physical Barrier builds a wall
    where you want it to be, with a Structure rating equal to (Magic + hits on a
    Sorcery + Magic test). The base spell casts a barrier that is two meters by
    two meters, two centimeters thick. The Increase Area effect can be applied
    to add up to two meters in length and width (but not depth) for each time
    the effect is chosen.
