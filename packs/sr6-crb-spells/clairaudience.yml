  description: >-
    The person on whom this is cast gains the ability to hear distant sounds.
    The subject may select and move the spot; the size of the spot is determined
    by normal area-of-effect rules and can be adjusted with Increase Area and
    moved with Shift Area. The subject can only hear sounds in the target area
    while this spell is in effect (as opposed to sounds near them), and any
    hearing augmentations they have do not have any effect.
