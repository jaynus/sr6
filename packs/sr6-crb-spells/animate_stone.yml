  description: >-
    A chunk of material of the affected type comes to life, moving as commanded
    by the spellcaster. Roll Sorcery + Magic vs. Object Resistance of
     the item/material being animated. Net hits on the Spellcasting test
    determin e the duration of the spell, as well as the volume of the material
    (1/2 cubi c meter per net hit). The material can move according to its form,
    but generall y it should not be faster than 5 meters per combat round unless
    it is a wheele d vehicle or something else with innate speed. The object is
    generally not capabl e of coordinated movements, so attacks from animated
    objects are slow and easil y blocked. Still, it might be able to level a
    blow at a motionless or unwary target,  doing 4P damage if its metal, 3P if
    stone, 2S if wood, 1S if plastic.  Commanding the animated substance
    requires a Minor Action. If someone is tryin g to keep the object from
    following your commands, use Spellcasting net hits +  4 (for metal), 3 (for
    stone), 2 (for wood), or 1 (for plastic) vs. opponent s Body + Strength to
    see if the object is impeded from acting on the command.
