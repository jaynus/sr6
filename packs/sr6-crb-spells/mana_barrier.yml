    Want a spirit-free room? Want a way to enforce your ba r s no foc i policy?
    Then a mana barrier is the way to go. This invisible wal l (visible only on
    the astral) will let people and non-magical objects throug h with no
    noticeable effect, but spirits, foci, dual-natured beings, alchemical
    preparations, reagents, and spells cant get through. Astrally projecting
    mages cant get through, either (though they can always try to go around).
    Unless they fight their way through, which they sometimes do, but it s good
    to make them struggle sometimes. To cast a mana barrier, roll Sorcery +
    Magic; (net hits + casters Magic) is the Structure rating of the astral wall
    you create. At the basic level, the spell creates a two-meterby- two-mete r
    barrier. The Increase Area effect can be added to add up to two meters in
    lengt h and width (but not depth) for each time the effect is chosen The
    barrier ca n be shaped as desired by the caster. For more information on
    mana barriers, se e p. 161.
