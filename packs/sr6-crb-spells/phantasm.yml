     (along with accompanying sounds and smells). Maybe its the image of an
    attacking dragon, or a peaceful garden, or of a specific individual whateve
    r it is, it has to be something the caster has seen before, and the phantasm
    mus t stay in their line of sight. The spellcaster rolls Sorcery + Magic;
    the ne t hits form the threshold of any Willpower + Intuition tests viewers
    must mak e to see through the illusion. Phantasm affects every living being
    that sees th e effect; Trid Phantasm affects cameras, microphones, and other
