    These spells are two sides of the same coin, changing the light level of
    your environment to suit you. For each net hit, you can raise (using Light)
    or lower (using Darkness) the light level of the surrounding area, which may
    help gain when it comes to determing Edge based on Environment and
    Visibility (p. 118). These are area spells, and they can be adjusted using
    Increase Area and Shift Area.
