    Magic does not always get along with tech, but sometimes they find a way to
    combine forces. With this spell, a mage can briefly amp up an electronic
     devices power, making it run better and faster. Roll Sorcery + Magic vs.
     Object Resistance. For each net hit, you can increase an attribute of the
    devic e (Device Rating, Attack, Data Processing, Firewall, or Sleaze) by 1.
    The caste r can decide to not use some net hits if they want to reduce wear
    and tear o n the device. This use of magic strains the device. After the
    spell is dropped,  the device takes Matrix Damage equal to the net hits
    used, resisted by Firewall.
