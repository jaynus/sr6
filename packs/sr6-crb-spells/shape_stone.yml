    These spells give you the ability to make the selected material malleable
    putty in your (mental) hands, essentially. You can shape the material as lon
    g as the spell is sustained; when the spell is dropped, the material retains
    whateve r form you gave it. Roll Sorcery + Magic vs. Object Resistance; the
    amount o f material you can shape is determined by net hits on that test.
    You can shap e 1 cubic meter of material per net hit (see the Volume
    Reference table, p. 139,  for information on just how much that is). In
    order to use this on an object,  the object does not have to be entirely
    made out of the selected material, bu t it should be predominantly made out
    of the material.
