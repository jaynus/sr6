  description: >-
    This spell lets the subject know if anyone within the sense s range has
    hostile intentions toward them. It only works on people not things,  and it
    only detects people who have hostility specifically to the subject, not
    generalized anger at all metahumanity (if it did, everyone in the barrens
    woul d light up). Great for detecting ambushes!
