  description: >-
    It may not be exactly the same as flight, but hey, its defyin g gravity, and
    its a blast. Roll Sorcery + Magic; for each hit, you ca n levitate 50 kilos
    worth of material or people. If its the latter and th e person is not
    particularly interested in being levitated, they can make a Bod y + Strength
    test, with each hit reducing your effective hits by 1. The target
     has to stay in sight if you want them to stay in the air; the minute they
    re out of sight, theyll be earthward bound. That, along with a sense of
    caution about raising someone too high when spells can be interrupted, tend
    s to put a cap on how high people are sent up into the air with this spell.
    Th e target does not have to hover. They can be moved by the caster at a
    rate o f (casters Magic rating) meters per turn. Moving them requires a
    Minor Action.
