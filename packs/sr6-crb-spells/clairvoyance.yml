  description: >-
    Like Clairaudience, but with visuals instead of sound, so: The person on
    whom this is cast gains the ability to see distant sights. The subject may
    select and move the spot; the size of the spot is determined by normal
    area-of-effect rules and can be adjusted with Increase Area and can be moved
    with Shift Area. The subject can only see visuals in the target area while
    this spell is in effect (as opposed to sights near them), and any visual
    augmentations they have do not have any effect.
