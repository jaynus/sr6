    Foci can be powerful aids for magicians, but who hasnt foun d themselves
    wanting to eke out a little more power from them every now and then?  With
    Focus Burst, you can get a little more out of your focus or give someone
    else a boost. Roll Sorcery + Magic vs. focus Force x 2. If you get any net
    hits,  increase the effective rating of the focus by 1 for (net hits)
    minutes. A critica l glitch on the Spellcasting test permanently reduces the
    Force of the focus b y 2.
