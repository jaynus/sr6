    Single-Sense: This spell affects only one sense. The target fade s from
    view, becoming transparent so that they can move unnoticed. Invisibility
    gives the targeted character the Invisible (#) status (p. 52), where the
    numbe r after the status becomes the threshold on any tests to see the
    character. Th e Invisible (Improved) spell gives the Improved Invisibility
    (#) status, whic h is essentially the same but works against cameras and
    other technology as wel l as against living entities.
