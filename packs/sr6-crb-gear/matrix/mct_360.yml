  description: >-
    When the corps cracked down on the Matrix, working hard to prevent illicit
    use of their pretty new system, the cyberdeck re-emerged as the tool for
    messing with innards of the Matrix. They are powerful devices in the hands
    of a skilled decker. The newest models look something like medieval bracers,
    only less bulky. They’re worn on the wrist and can project keyboards (or
    whatever interface the user prefers) onto the user’s arm, a nearby sur-
    face, or just the air around them. Some models have screens; most don’t.
    They tend to look like a block with a series of ports, though many deckers
    connect to their deck wirelessly. For more infor- mation about them, see
    Devices, p. 174. All cyber- decks include hot-sim modules.
