    This device uses a laser beam to project a visible dot (normal, low-light,
    or thermographic) on the target. This increases the weapon’s Attack Rating
    by 1, not cumulative with smartlink modifiers. The laser sight can be
    mounted as either an underbarrel mount or top mount. Activating or
    deactivating a laser sight is a Minor Action. Note that in weapons with a
    laser sight included as standard equipment, this bonus is already calculated
    into the Attack Rating.
