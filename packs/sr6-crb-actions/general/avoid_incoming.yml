  description: >-
    A character can use this action when it is not their player turn to get away
    from an incoming Blast or Gas attack. With this action, a character makes a
    Reaction + Athletics – Dodge Penalty roll (see Dodge Penalty table, p. 311,
    for these values). Hits on the test allow a character to move a number of
    meters equal to their hits in a direction of their choosing, but they
    shouldn’t know the results of the scatter until after they decide which way
    they’re headed. If they choose to move more than 2 meters, they dive to the
    ground at the end of their defense and gain the Prone status. This action
    cannot be used if the character has taken a previous Avoid Incoming, Move,
    or Sprint action this combat round and prevents the use of another Avoid
    Incoming, Move, or Sprint action for the remainder of the combat round.
