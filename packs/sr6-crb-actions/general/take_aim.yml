  description: >-
    A character gains a +1 dice pool bonus with the use of this action. The
    action can only be taken once per combat round, but if the bonus is not
    used, it carries over to the next combat round, allowing it to be combined
    with actions taken over the course of several combat rounds. If the
    character takes a player turn without taking the Take Aim or Attack actions,
    any carryover bonuses from previous rounds are lost. The maximum dice pool
    bonus from the use of this action is equal to the characterâ€™s Willpower. A
    character may take aim with a ready firearm, bow, or exotic ranged weapon.
    If the character is using vision magnification or a targeting scope, the
    Take Aim action must be used to line up the shot in order to receive any
    bonus from the item. In this case, the first action of Take Aim does not
    provide any additional bonus beyond enabling the function of the
    modification.
