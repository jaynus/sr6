  description: >-
    A character may make a detailed observation b taking a Major Action. This
    action allows a Perception test (see Perception, p. 96) or Assensing test
    (p.159). This action is intended for determining detail that may be obscured
    due to the pace and rigor of combat. It is assumed that everyone engaged i a
    combat is aware of the presence of everyone else, barring the use of Stealth
    or obscuring magic, but no necessarily details of their gear or equipment,
    and i some particularly hectic or rushed circumstances, th identity of
    individuals. In the midst of a hectic gunfight/brawl in the dark, the winner
    of the brawl, wh is now sprinting toward your character, may not b
    identifiable without an Observe in Detail action.
