    Counterspelling is the equal and opposite reaction to spellcasting.
    Magicians give benefits through spells, while other magicians use their
    gifts to take them the hell away. Counterspelling is a spellcaster’s quick
    reaction defense, and it comes in one of two forms: boosted defense and
    dispelling.

    Boosted Defense This is the pre-emptive defense, where spellcasters try to
    block an incoming spell. To use it, characters take a Counterspell Major
    Action and roll a Sorcery + Magic test. At its base, the action affects a
    sphere in the caster’s LOS with a two-meter radius (the radius can be
    increased by 1 meter per dram of reagents spent). Net hits on the test are
    added to the dice pool of anyone in the area to defend against any spells.
    This boost lasts for a number of combat rounds equal to the Magic of the
    spellcaster.

    Dispelling This is for use against spells that are sustained or otherwise
    have ongoing effects. The character chooses the Counterspell action and then
    rolls Sorcery + Magic vs. Drain Value of the spell x 2 (including any
    adjustments made to the spell when it was cast). Net hits on this test
    cancel net hits on the spell on a one-to-one basis; when net hits reach
    zero, the spell is completely dispelled.
