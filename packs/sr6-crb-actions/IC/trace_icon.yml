    You find the physical location of a device or persona in the Matrix. After
    succeeding with this action, you know the target’s location for as long as
    you can detect the target. This doesn’t work on IC or hosts that have no
    physical location, but it does work on offline hosts with physical hardware
    (although if you can access one of those to trace it, you probably know
    where it is already).
