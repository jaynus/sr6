    Patrol IC is often the first line of defense in hosts, since it doesn’t
    escalate any confrontations, but in stead gives the host’s owners a good
    sense of what’s going on. When it is activated, make a Matrix Perception
    roll for the Patrol IC; that serves as hits on Matrix Perception actions it
    takes every in-game minute it is active. That means one of the Patrol IC’s
    Minor Actions is always given over to Matrix Perception. Reroll the Matrix
    Perception test once per minute.
