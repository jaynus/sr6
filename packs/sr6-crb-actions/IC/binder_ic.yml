    Where Acid IC wants to reduce your defenses, Binder IC wants to slow down
    all of your functionality—and keep you from running as many programs as you
    would like. When Binder IC hits in cybercombat, the target’s Data Processing
    attribute is reduced by 1 per net hit. When Data Processing hits 0, no
    Matrix actions can be performed until it hits 1 or higher. Lost points are
    restored after leaving the host, at a rate of 1 point per minute.
