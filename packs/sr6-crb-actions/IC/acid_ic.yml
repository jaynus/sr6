    Acid IC is about wearing down the defenses of intruders so that the other IC
    can finish it off. When Acid IC hits in cybercombat, the targetâ€™s Firewall
    attribute is reduced by 1 per net hit, reducing the effective defenses. Lost
    points are restored after leaving the host, at a rate of 1 point per minute.
