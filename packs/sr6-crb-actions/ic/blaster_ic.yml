    Blaster IC isn’t fun, but at least it’s not as focused on killing you as
    Black IC is. Yeah, it might want to subject you to all sorts of unpleasant
    Matrix-based torture, but you have to be alive to experience pain, so that’s
    something, right? In cyber-combat, this does (Rating) Matrix damage while
    also link-locking the target.
