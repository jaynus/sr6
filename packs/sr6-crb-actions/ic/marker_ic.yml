    Marker IC is a response to too many back- doors—if hackers are going to
    start preferring Sleaze options to make and secure backdoors into hosts,
    then hosts are going to keep hackers from having high Sleaze ratings. In
    cybercombat, when Marker IC hits, the target’s Sleaze attribute is reduced
    by 1 per net hit. No actions using the Sleaze rating can be performed when
    the Sleaze rating is 0. Lost points are restored after leaving the host, at
    a rate of 1 point/minute.
