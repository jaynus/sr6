    A successful test gives you information about the target. With a tie, you
    can perceive the itemâ€™s icon. A single net hit will give you basic
    information, such as device rating, or whatever name the device or icon
    calls itself. Two net hits will give you more specific information,
    including individual attribute ratings, and what programs it is currently
    running. Additional hits will give you more information based on what the
    gamemaster wishes to reveal. This test can also be used to attempt to spot
    any icons in the vicinity that are running silent.
