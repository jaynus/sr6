    You rewrite the boot code of the target device. The next time it would
    reboot, it instead shuts down for good, or until its software can be
    replaced. A device that has been shut down in this fashion loses all of its
    wireless modifiers but can still be used as a normal mechanism (a door with
    a manual handle can be opened, a gun with a trigger can be fired, etc.), and
    it cannot be accessed from the Matrix. Repairing a formatted device follows
    the same rules as repairing a bricked device (see Bricked Devices, p. 175),
    requiring a number of hits equal to the deviceâ€™s Device Rating to restore
    the corrupted boot code.
