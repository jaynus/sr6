  description: >-
    You probe a network for weaknesses, looking to gain access. By taking your
    time not to alert any security to your presence, you can create an exploit
    that may last until you are ready to use it. While not as fast as using
    Brute Force, Probing a network does not raise an alarm automatically. Even
    if your attempt initially fails, it will not trigger an alarm unless you
    glitch. A successful Probe creates a backdoor in the system to exploit. Once
    you create the exploit, you may then use the Backdoor Entry action at a
    later time. Net hits on this test count as a dice pool bonus on your future
    Backdoor Entry test. The duration of these backdoors depends on the PAN or
    host—most systems create a changelog and will automatically correct and
    report differences to their configurations caused by the presence of these
    exploits. Generally speaking, the backdoor lasts for [10 – Host/Device
    Rating] hours or until you go offline. This action is linked to the Sleaze
    attribute.
