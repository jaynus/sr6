    This action turns the wireless device you are using into a local jammer. As
    long as you do not use the device for any further Matrix actions, the device
    adds any hits you get on the test to the noise rating for all Matrix actions
    conducted by or targeting any devices within 100 meters. If you want
    selective jamming or directional jamming, buy a jammer—that’s what they’re
    for.
