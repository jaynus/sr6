  description: >-
    This action is linked to the Attack attribute. You directly attack a device,
    flooding it with re- quests, commands, queries, and other junk code in order
    to create an exploit to give you access. Brute Force is by far the fastest
    way to gain illicit access to a device, but it carries with it many risks.
    Using Brute Force will always alert the device you are at- tempting to gain
    access to, so GOD score accumu- lates with each test. Should you fail a
    Brute Force attempt to gain access, you may attempt another on the next
    combat round.     If the hacker is attempting to gain User or Admin access,
    the opposed roll is Willpower + Firewall. When attempting to gain Admin
    access without first having gained User access, the opposed roll is Will-
    power + (Firewall + 2), and the target is granted a +4 bonus to their
    Defense Rating for that Test.
