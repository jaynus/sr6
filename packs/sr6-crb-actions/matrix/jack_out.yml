  description: >-
    This action jacks you out of the Matrix and reboots the device you are
    using. You suffer dumpshock if you were in VR. The defense pool only applies
    if you’ve been link-locked by someone; the test is against the icon that
    locked your link. If more than one persona has you link-locked, you need to
    beat each of them individually: use a single roll and compare your hits to
    rolls from each opponent who had established a link-lock. You can only jack
    out yourself. You can’t dump other people except by beating them into
    submission through Matrix damage.
