  description: >-
    This action is linked to the Sleaze Attribute. You attempt to use a backdoor
    you have put in place to gain illicit entry into a host, device, or other
    Matrix area. This action can only be used if you have previously used Probe
    on the target suc- cessfully; net hits from that successful Probe count as a
    dice-pool bonus on this test. If the test is suc- cessful, you gain Admin
    access to the target, and it does not count as illegal Admin access (though
    taking illegal Matrix Actions will still increase your Overwatch Score). If
    this test fails, the back- door you have made was detected and removed, and
    you cannot attempt Backdoor Entry again with the same host until a new
    backdoor is made through the Probe Action. Failing this test does not
    immediately set off alarms, but the characterâ€™s OS increases as normal.
