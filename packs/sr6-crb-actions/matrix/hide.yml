    When you muck about in the Matrix, you’ll probably be spotted by another
    icon, even if you’re running silent. You can use this action to make a
    target lose you. If you succeed, the target stops spotting you and needs to
    perform a new Matrix Perception action against you if it wants to find you
    again. You can’t hide from an icon that has gained User or Admin access to
    anything in your network.
