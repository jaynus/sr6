  description: >-
    You jump into a device that has a rigger adaptation, usually a vehicle or a
    drone. There’s a list of things you need to have in order to jump into a
    device: you have to have the proper access level on the device you want to
    jump into, you have to be in VR, the device you want to jump into has to
    have a rigger adaptation, and you have to have a control rig. If you are the
    device’s owner, or the device’s owner has given you permission to jump into
    the device, you don’t need to make a test. In the Matrix, the icon of the
    device you jumped into becomes part of your persona and it cannot be
    targeted by matrix actions while you are jumped in. If someone else is
    currently jumped into the device, you cannot attempt this action.
