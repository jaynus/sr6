  description: >-
    This action allows extended remote control of a device. You maintain control
    until you relin- quish command or are forced out of the system. While you
    have control, you can use the device as if you were the owner using a
    standard skill test, including turning the device off if you have Admin
    access. If there is no test associated with the device you wish to use, use
    Electronics + Logic vs. Firewall + Willpower. This test assumes you are
    using the device directly, not command- ing a device to use another (such as
    commanding a drone to fire its weapon). A Control Device action versus a
    device currently “jumped into” by a rigger automatically fails.     When you
    use Control Device, you may take any action that would normally require the
    level of access you currently have. Hacking User access allows you to take
    any action that would normally require legitimate User access. Actions that
    nor- mally require legitimate Admin access will likewise require hacked
    Admin access to perform. The Attributes you’ll use for Control Device Tests
    may change based on whether you are in AR or VR while using it. If you are
    using a device via Augmented Reality, and the de- vice requires a Physical
    attribute, use your normal Physical attribute for this test. If you are
    using this device via Virtual Reality, and the device requires a Physical
    attribute, substi- tute the appropriate Mental attribute for this test.
    (Body = Willpower, Agility = Logic, Reaction = Intuition, Strength =
    Charisma).
