    This is a specialized Matrix search, made illegal by the fact that it
    searches for an encrypted file by matching it to a hash value (GOD does not
    appreciate people trying to skirt encryption). By searching for a specific
    value, the characters can find an encrypted document on a host or device
    without first having to decrypt every document to find the right one. This
    works best if Mr. Johnson provided the hash value to them, but in a pinch
    the search can be done with the character’s best guess. The threshold is 1
    if you have a hash value from Mr. Johnson or some other source, 4 if you are
    doing the best on your own. Meeting the threshold means you have narrowed
    the number of possibly matching files down to 32; for every net hit, that
    number is divided in half (so there are 16 files with 1 net hit, 8 with 2,
    etc.). If the number of possible matches still seems too large after the
    initial test, the test can be repeated with the –2 dice pool penalty for
    repeating an action (see p. 36). Success on this subsequent test, along with
    any net hits, serves to divide the number of possible matches in half.
