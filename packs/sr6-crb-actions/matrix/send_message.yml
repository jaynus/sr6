    You send a text or audio message the length of a short sentence, an image,
    or a file via the Matrix to a user whose commcode you have. If you’re using
    the Matrix through a DNI, even if you’re in AR, you can send longer and more
    complicated messages, about a paragraph worth of text. You can also use this
    action to open a live feed to one or more recipients, using any digital
    recording devices you have.
