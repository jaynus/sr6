    Sometimes you want to deliver as much hurt as possible; sometimes you want
    to deliver a little pain and a little slowness, in order to make the rest of
    your blows land easier. If you succeed in making this attack, do (1 + net
    hits) damage to the icon you attacked while also reducing their Data
    Processing rating by the same amount. If a deviceâ€™s Data Processing rating
    is reduced to 0, the user cannot perform a Matrix action until it is 1 or
    more. The Data Processing rating recovers at a rate of 1 point per combat
    round.
