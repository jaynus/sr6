    You attempt to disarm a Data Bomb that you have detected (usually as the
    result of a Matrix Perception action). If you score any net hits, the Data
    Bomb is removed and deleted. If not, the Data Bomb activates, causing its
    damage and possibly destroying any file to which it was attached (assuming
    it was set to destroy the file).
