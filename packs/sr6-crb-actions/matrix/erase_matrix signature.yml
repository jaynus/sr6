  description: >-
    You eradicate a Matrix signature that has been left by a Resonance being,
    such as a technomancer or a sprite. If the test is successful, the signature
    dissipates. You must have a Resonance rating to attempt this action. Unlike
    other actions that need Resonance, this oneâ€™s a real Matrix Action, and
    illegal to boot, so you risk Matrix damage and Overwatch Score when you use
    it.
