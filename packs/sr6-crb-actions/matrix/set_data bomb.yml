    You set a Data Bomb in a file. Choose the rating of the Data Bomb, up to the
    net hits on your test. You also need to choose whether or not the Data Bomb
    will delete the file to which it is attached when activated, and the
    passcode required to deactivate it. A file can only have one Data Bomb on it
    at a time. The Data Bomb is triggered when someone attempts to read, edit,
    copy, protect, delete, or place another Data Bomb on the file without
    disarming the Data Bomb that’s already in place. When a Data Bomb goes off,
    it causes (Rating x 2) Matrix Damage (resisted with Willpower) to the icon
    that tripped it, deletes the file (if it was set that way), and then is
    itself deleted. If the passcode is used, the Data Bomb doesn’t activate.
    Instead, it remains attached to the file, waiting for the next guy. A Data
    Bomb can be detected using Matrix Perception. If it’s detected, it can be
    defused with the Disarm Data Bomb action; a disarmed Data Bomb is deleted.
