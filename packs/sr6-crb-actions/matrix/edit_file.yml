    Edit File allows you to create, change, copy, delete, or protect any kind of
    file. The defender is either the host holding the file or the owner of the
    file (if it’s not on a host). Each action is enough to alter one detail of a
    file—a short paragraph of text, a single detail of an image, or two or three
    seconds of video or audio (you and your gamemaster can work out what exactly
    “one detail” means). Your gamemaster may impose penalties on the test if
    your edit is particularly intricate or tricky. If you want to perform a
    continuous edit, such as removing your teammates from a video feed, you need
    to perform this action once per combat round for as long as you want to keep
    the edit going. If you use this action to copy a file, you are the new
    file’s owner. If the file you want to copy has protection on it, this action
    automatically fails. If the file has a Data Bomb, the Data Bomb goes off on
    you (so try to remember to scan files before you open them).
