  description: >-
    You overload part of your target’s memory and scramble one of its running
    programs. You need to specify which program you’re trying to crash; you can
    learn what your target is running either with a Matrix Perception action or
    by observing the program in action. If you succeed, the program is
    scrambled: it ends and cannot be restarted until the device it was running
    on is rebooted.
